<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am Justine C. Aquino, 26 years old. I live in the Philippines. I took Bachelor of Secondary Education - Major in Mathematics.
   I have no working experience as a teacher but I have an experience with other industry such as being a purchasing staff and siding designer in HRD Group.</p>

<p>The reason why I don't have any experience of my profession is my eagerness to explore a new job aside from being a teacher.
  I believe that I can share what I've learned from that experience to my students, especially for those senior high students.
</p>

<p>This website I've made is to show off my portfolio. I am just a beginner and still learning from this kind of Job.</p>
